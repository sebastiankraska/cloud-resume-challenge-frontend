# 🤖 Fun with Generative AI 😄

<em>Honestly:</em> This site was built with Terraform, is hosted on AWS and features a serverless visit count in the footer. It is based on the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) and its [Terraform Extension](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/terraform-getting-started/).
