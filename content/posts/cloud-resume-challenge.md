title: Using Better Tools Isn't Cheating—It's Just Better

description: You feel guilty using Claude Code. You shouldn't. This essay tears apart the idea that suffering equals learning, exposes the gatekeeping disguised as mentorship, and makes a first-principles argument for why your senior dev would absolutely use AI tools if they could time-travel. Tools change. Learning stays the same. Stop comparing your process to other people's constraints.

So I started using Claude Code as a debugging partner and immediately felt like I'd committed some kind of crime against software development.

This is insane. Let me explain why.

## The Entire Premise is Backwards

Everyone's pretending that suffering = learning. This is basically religion dressed up as mentorship. "Back in my day we used hand tools and it was HARD and that made us STRONG." 

Okay, grandfather. If you had a chainsaw, would you still use the hand saw? No. You'd use the chainsaw because you're not an idiot.

The reason my predecessors didn't use AI debuggers is the same reason they didn't have smartphones or electricity: **they didn't exist yet**. They would have absolutely demolished their previous learning time if they'd had Claude Code. They'd have had more time for what actually matters: understanding.

But instead we're supposed to feel guilty for using objectively superior tools. This is the guilt industrial complex, and it's complete nonsense.

## What Actually Happens When You Learn

Let me break this down to first principles:
1. You encounter a problem
2. You solve it (using whatever tools are available)
3. You understand WHY it worked
4. You remember it
5. You're smarter now

The tool is irrelevant. It could be Stack Overflow. It could be your senior dev. It could be Claude Code. It could be a ouija board if the ouija board was giving you good advice.

What matters is steps 3-5. Those steps don't change based on your tool selection.

## The Comparison Game is a Trap

Here's where people get trapped: they compare their *process* to what they imagine the senior developer's process was.

> Well, he had to memorize it.

Did he? Or did he google it six times and copy-paste it from Stack Overflow and gradually understand what was happening? 

You're not competing with his *process*. You're competing with his *results*. And if you get the same results—actually understanding the code, being able to apply the concepts, building better things—then who cares what tools you used?

The hand saw guy didn't have a better saw. He had less options. He adapted. He succeeded anyway.

We have more options. Using them isn't weakness. It's just... using the tools available to us.

## The Real Insecurity

The guilt isn't actually about learning. It's about this weird idea that struggle = virtue.

> I had to suffer, so you should too.

This is the logic of hazing. This is the logic of gatekeeping. This is the logic of people who benefited from scarcity wanting to maintain scarcity because it made them special.

But you're not special for suffering unnecessarily. You're just... suffering.

Use Claude Code. Use it aggressively. Use it to debug faster. Use it to understand code better. Use it to ask questions about what you're seeing.

The question isn't "is this cheating?" 

The question is: "am I actually learning?"

If yes, then you're good. The tool is irrelevant.

## Stop Internalizing Other People's Constraints

Your grandfather used hand tools because hand tools were the state of the art. This wasn't noble. It was just... reality.

You have better tools. This is objectively better. Not morally superior. Not impressive. Just better.

If your senior dev could time-travel and use Claude Code when they were learning, they 100% would. They'd weep with joy at the opportunity.

Don't pretend constraints were features. Constraints were constraints.

Use the tools. Feel zero guilt. Get smart faster. Build better things.

That's it. That's the whole thing.

<sub>Seriously though, the people still using hand saws while electric saws exist aren't making some profound philosophical point. They're just using outdated tools. That's all. Do you want to be that person? And if so, why?</sub>
