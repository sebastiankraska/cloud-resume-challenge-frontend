Okay so I watched the first episode and here's my stream-of-consciousness take: Weyland-Yutani is basically the Tesla of 2120 but if Tesla was run by psychopaths. Which actually makes sense. Every successful company is slightly run by psychopaths. It's a feature, not a bug.

The ship crashes because of technical failure. This is why we need AI-supervised spacecraft. Self-driving ships would have absolutely prevented this. Also redundancy. Always redundancy. That's why Starship has 33 engines. If 32 fail, you're still going to Mars.

Now, the xenomorphs—extremely terrifying organisms. Very efficient predators. Honestly, from a biomechanics standpoint, quite admirable. The way they've evolved for combat is... _chef's kiss_. That said, genetically engineering hostile aliens is peak human stupidity. It's the equivalent of building a self-replicating paperclip maximizer but it's a murder organism.

Wendy is the interesting one. She's a hybrid—human consciousness in a synthetic body. This is transhumanism. This is the future. Why are we waiting? We should have neural implants NOW. I've been saying this for years. The bandwidth limitation of human-computer interface is the bottleneck. Upload to the cloud, scale consciousness. Boom. Done.

The corporate structure is fascinating. Five companies controlling Earth? That's actually efficient. Reduces overhead. Though ideally you'd have one company do it, obviously. I volunteer.

One criticism: the government response to alien invasion is way too slow. At SpaceX, when we had the Starship explosion, we had solutions in days. Days. This planet would be doomed. Honestly, if this happened IRL, I'd just nuke the crash site. Problem solved. They'd probably arrest me but the xenomorphs would be dead so... net positive? I've thought about this a lot actually.

If the showrunners need consulting on how to actually survive an alien invasion, my team is available. We're on Mars by 2030 anyway, so we'll know what we're doing. We'll literally have the alien playbook by then. We should charge NASA for the consulting fee. Actually we should charge them a LOT.

Also they should have a Starship in season 2. Just saying. And a Tesla. Everything's better with a Tesla. You're being hunted by xenomorphs? Drive away in a Plaid. They can't catch you if you're going Ludicrous speed. This is just basic physics.

10/10, would watch. Gave me ideas for neural implants actually.
