title: Using Better Tools Isn't Cheating — It's Just Better
date: 2025-11-09T18:52:00+0100
description: You feel guilty using Claude Code. You shouldn't. This essay tears apart the idea that suffering equals learning, exposes the gatekeeping disguised as mentorship, and makes a first-principles argument for why your senior dev would absolutely use AI tools if they could time-travel. Tools change. Learning stays the same. Stop comparing your process to other people's constraints.

## The old way wasn't that pure either

Imagine a senior developer today. He started ten years ago as a junior developer by watching YouTube tutorials and copy-and-pasted code from Stack Overflow. Now, he is a senior developer, so _obviously_ his process works.

Here's where people get trapped: they compare their _process_ to what they imagine the senior developer's process was.

> Well, he had to memorize it.

Did he? Or did he google it six times and copy-paste it from Stack Overflow and gradually understand what was happening?

You're not competing with his _process_. You're competing with his _results_. And if you get the same results — actually understanding the code, being able to apply the concepts, building better things — then who cares what tools you used?

The real question isn't whether you should use AI. It's whether you're learning or building something real.

## Fake work vs. real work

I think we need to redefine hard, honest work. And media depications do not help: TV show hackers are typing fast. But that's entertainment. Real learning is boring: reading, trying, failing, thinking. Looking into the void. Then reading again. Nobody puts that on screen.

Maybe we can define hard (intellectual) work as tasks you need to be sober for. Something like this:

> If you can do the task while drunk, it's probably not worth much money.

This seems true. Most well-paid jobs require clear thinking, understanding complexity, recognizing what actually matters.

## AI as a roommate

Think of Claude Code as a retired software engineer living in your apartment. He's rich, he has time, he loves helping. He reads your code and logs in seconds. He has great ideas almost always. Why wouldn't you ask him questions?

One reason: you think he'll make you dumb. Fair point if you just copy-paste without reading. But there's another way. Read carefully. Understand the errors. Find the first domino that fell. Get curious instead of angry when things break.

Your roommate isn't afraid of big codebases. So you don't have to be either. By reading and practicing, chaos becomes structure. The screen and the codebase stays the same. Only your brain changes—but that's the whole point.

## The metrics that matters

> Are you learning?

Learning shows up when you can do the job interview. If you are in a job interview and cannot explain what you have built and how you understand things, then you are in trouble.[^1]

> Are you building?

Building shows up in your Github or your blog. Shift from consuming to producing (which is often "goal-based consumption", so you still consume but in a much more useful, targeted way).

## Valuable skills in the age of AI:

- **Clear thinking.** Writing helps with this. So does coding. Same thing really—being logical, structured, understandable to others.
- **Good taste.** Knowing when something is ugly and complicated. Trusting your instinct enough to push back on AI output.
- **Knowing what actually matters and what's noise.** Not falling into every rabbit hole just to avoid the real work.

## The point

You can suck at coding when using Claude Code. But that does not mean you get good at coding when you don't use Claude Code. Not using AI is not the solution to anything.

Whether you use AI or not, you still have to show up. You still have to think. You still have to do the work.

That part doesn't change.

[^1]: Yes, I am sure someone currently works on an AI hearing aid — a ChatGPT instance listening to everything, like a soufleur feeding you lines. Maybe even listening to your voice and accommodating. But I think you'd still need to be one hell of an actor to be really convincing. And if you are maybe you just go act in theatre instead, not become a professional imposter at a software company.
