So Ethan Hunt is basically a founder who's trying to exit the business but keeps getting dragged back in. Classic problem. You build something, you prove it works, but then the organization becomes dependent on you. That's a scalability failure.

His team is solid. Good specialization. But they're operating at unsustainable burn rate—private jets, custom weapons, international operations. The cost-per-mission is astronomical. At some point, you need to ask: is this business model actually viable? Or are they just hemorrhaging resources?

The villain—Davian—he's trying to acquire a weapon called the Rabbit's Foot, which is literally just a MacGuffin. It doesn't matter what it is. It's the IDEA of a valuable thing. That's actually a genius plot device because it's a metaphor for what drives all conflict: perceived value.

But here's where Ethan's approach breaks down: he's operating on emotional motivation (saving the girl) rather than strategic thinking. A good founder would step back and ask "Is this the right problem to solve? What's my long-term goal?" Instead, Ethan is reactive. He's constantly improvising.

The bridge sequence—that's good. He's adapting when the plan fails. That's the entrepreneurial instinct. Plans fail. You pivot. You move forward.

My main critique: the IMF organization itself is bloated. Too much overhead. Too many layers. They need to right-size. Either commit to being a lean startup-style operation or become a massive government bureaucracy. Right now they're stuck in the middle, which is the worst place to be.

Also, his personal life is a liability. He's emotionally compromised. In startup terms, that's founder distraction. You can't have undiversified attention.

Rating: 6/10. Good execution, but the underlying business model is fundamentally broken. He should've negotiated better terms with the IMF before re-engaging.
